Tested with asset “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby“ from Popular Movies rail on a new profile, after watching until the end before credits, waited for more than an hour (and almost half a day), I am still seeing this asset under Popular Movies.

Bug - https://wbdstreaming.atlassian.net/browse/GQA-20802

This also affects Query-generated and Curated Rails like Popular Movies and Popular TV.
